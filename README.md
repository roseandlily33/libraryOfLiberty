## Difficutlies:
This was the first project that I've done that has been a 2 page thing, so learning how to do that took a minute. And then there always a learning curve with whatever API your using. I had a little trouble getting this one to work for me and to display the results.

## Succeses:


## Things I would do different:
So I had left this project and only did the html and css which when I went to the 2nd page I wish I would have done the CSS a bit different in the way that I would have made a 3rd sheet, made the :root colours and then a different style sheet for both of the 2 html pages. So there would be 3 in total.
