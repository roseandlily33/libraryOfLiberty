## Difficulties:
This project was overall not too difficult, the main difficulty was that (and still is) the main page, I tried so many things to try and get this to take it from one page transfer it to the next and display the data and for some reason that no one knows why .addEventListener was the issue, and I checked 800 times, made sure everything was the name it was supposed to be but still no luck. But it does work and displays results based on what you type in. 


## Things I would do different:
So I had left this project and only did the html and css which when I went to the 2nd page I wish I would have done the CSS a bit different in the way that I would have made a 3rd sheet, made the :root colours and then a different style sheet for both of the 2 html pages. So there would be 3 in total.
